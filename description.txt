Mod intended for a painful co-op experience.

Current triggers for flipping gravity are:
Default:
- Gravity Potion
- Gravity Globe
Optional:
- Jumping
- Receiving damage

Known bugs/features:
- Can change gravity while grappled (feature)
- Spamming gravity flips can cause some temporary desync of affected players
- Not dying or triggering a gravity flux while playing continiously for ~1.135 years will cause the inverted player to revert to unpolarised gravity until the next flux or death
