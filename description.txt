Mod intended for a painful co-op experience.

Current triggers for flipping gravity are:
Default:
- Gravity Potion
- Gravity Globe
Optional:
- Jumping
- Receiving damage

Known bugs/features:
- Underflow error when handling packets after receiving damage (I'm baffled at this point)
- Can change gravity while grappled (feature)
- Spamming gravity flips can cause some temporary desync
